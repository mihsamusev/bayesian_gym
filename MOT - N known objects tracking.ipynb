    "# Tracking n objects\n",
    "The SOT model developed previously was only capable of tracking a single object and estimate its state $x_k$ in clutter and missed detections. Generalization of SOT is the ability to track $n$ objects and estimate the state matrix $X_k = [x_k^1, x_k^2,...,x_k^n]$ where $n$ is assumed to be both known and constant. The clutter and the missed detections will be included as well. The crux of $n$ object tracking is handling many data association problem. \n",

Similarly to SOT the clutter is Poisson point process with intensity $\\lambda_c(c) = \\bar{\\lambda}_cf_c(c)$ depending on the clutter rate and the spatial PFD. The object detections, however, are now $O_k = [O_k^1,...O_k^i,...,O_k^n]$. Nevertheless, for $O_k^i$ same measurement model as in SOT applies, namely:\n",
