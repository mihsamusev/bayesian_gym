# bayesian_gym
Collection of courses, examples, notebooks to train many important modern applications of Bayesian filtering such as state estimation, sensor fusion, linear and nonlinear filtering, single and multi-object tracking and more

# Sources
1) edX course - [Sensor Fusion and Non-linear Filtering for Automotive Systems](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ChalmersX+ChM015x+2T2020/course/). 
__Pros:__ Free. Really good theoretical background for Bayesian filtering and detailed mathematical derrivation of linear, extended, uncented and cubature Kalman filters together with particle filters. The course asks you do complete a few exercises after each lecture to deepen the new knowledge.
__Cons:__ Most useful project-like exercises, for example MATLAB coding of filters is hidden behind approx 300 USD paycheck.

__Pros:__
__Cons:__
3) [filterpy](https://filterpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#id6) and [companion book](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/table_of_contents.ipynb)
__Pros:__
__Cons:__

# TODO
0) Create Pipenv
1) Add interesting datasets fx single object tracking from Malthes thesis, bugs for MOT, and more. The more different the etter
2)
